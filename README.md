## About me
Hi I'm Sam, I have recently completed the Software Engineering bootcamp through Hyperion Dev and am continuing to grow my tech skills in my spare time. Currently working through a Udemy full stack course to expand on my knowledge of Javascript, Express, Node, Mongo, authentication and deployment. 
Looking to become a web developer.
